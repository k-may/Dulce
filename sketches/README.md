# Sketches Summary:


The following are brief descriptions of the sketches.

### dulceFloat1

Just thinking about a floating movement

### dulceFloat2

Same as float1, just more particles

### dulceNoise1

Some movements on particles using noise

### dulceParticles1

Assembled the prior sketches with some debug controls. Nice results

### dulceParticles2

Different direction, wanted to start playing with the merging of particles. Includes controls for changing the direction and speed of the noise.

### dulceTexture1

Thinking about creating a fluid ps style background. Also using noise

### dulceTexture2

Similar to the previous, but with multiple colors (would be nice to add a color picker option, and many have the colors change dynamically)

### dulcePhysics1

Playing around with the toxilibs librarie for verlet physics. Wanted to just create a shape that holds its form after an impact.

### dulcePhysics2

Similar to the first physics experiment, wanted to try multiple forms to basically test performance. Tried to impliment some collision detection, though its not native to the toxilibs library.

### dulcePhysics3

Multiple forms again, this time the forms are user-created. The main challenge here was in preserving the bezier vertex.'
The resolution of the lines here are variable (would be nice to add a slider or two!)

### dulceEmpathy

Based on a discussion we had concerning creating an empathetic experience, I've implimented a simple blinking eye form based on the joan miro painting. Though it might be a good place to start conceptualizing what we want to see in terms of what is possible emotionally. Note: includes the penner easing library; can be found here : https://github.com/jesusgollonet/processing-penner-easing
