Dulce
=====

Dulse is a wall-sized, digital interactive children’s picture book installation designed for pre-verbal and pre-school children and their families. Approaching this wall-sized storybook, the children touch the screen. Each contact creates a new creature which transforms as it journeys across the ‘page.’ Like bedtime stories, which are imaginative experiences shared between child and parent, the storybook is a prop, a tool, a premise or platform for a shared moment, an engaging bonding experience, with the mutual creation of meaning – reinforcing natural curiosity and exercising imagination for young and old.
